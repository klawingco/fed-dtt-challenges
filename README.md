# FED DTT Challenges 

A collection of FED coding challenges facilitated by Deloitte's (DCPDC) FED team

Tools needed
- Yarn or Npm
- NVM (Install Node version 16.14.2 or above) Or Standalone Node JS installation
- VS Code (with Prettier and ESLint extensions installed)

Usage:
While this looks like a mono repo. The projects are not configured to work as a mono repo but rather configured on their own. 
To avoid lint issues, Open the specific project folder in VS code.

Starter template has ESLint and Prettier setup already.

Gotcha's
- You can restart Eslint Server by CTRL +SHIFT + P and Selecting Restart EsLint Server

- nvm use only works for WSL or Linux or Mac. nvm use doesnt work on nvm for windows.
